<h2>Exploring Bexhill Museum’s catalogues with AI</h2>

<p>
Thompson is an experimental AI / Machine Learning platform that uses individual museum records to create short labels and contextualised summaries, drawn from the raw data we hold on the 35,000+ artefacts listed in our collection management records (MODES).

<p>
If Thompson can be ‘trained’ to do this reliably, without the peculiar guesses and ‘hallucinations’ that trouble basic AI-enhanced systems, the information it produces could eventually be used in an in-house speech app for the blind and deaf, and the visually and/or hearing impaired.

<p>
But Thompson can also be used as a ‘diagnostic’ tool, testing the effect that records short on information or mis-categorised have on the labels & summaries. This will allow us to highlight records that need review. The system does not affect the MODES records themselves.

<p>
We can also test the effect that supplementary information has on Thompson’s ML driven summaries, by importing texts taken from the museum’s extensive in-house research carried out by its many curators, volunteers and passing experts over more than 100 years.

<p>
The process of developing Thompson over the next 12 months started with a basic ‘proof of concept’ model in July 2024, developing there after as a test bed for processing information drawn exclusively from within the Museum’s own information environment.

<p>
The process will be documented for a working paper and the system’s results run, repeated, compared so that Thompson’s code and its ‘prompting’ can be elaborated later on. The paper will also examine how we deal with ethical issues such as credits, copyright, GDPR rights, etc.

<p>
For more information contact Rohan Jayasekera (<a href="mailto:administration@bexhillmuseum.org.uk">administration@bexhillmuseum.org.uk</a>). We hope to be able to open up the system for external review in summer 2025. <a href="https://www.bexhillmuseum.org.uk/">Bexhill Museum</a> is a registered educational charity no. 1102638 and an Accredited Museum.
