* A set of HTML, CSS and image files that define a web front end.
* A set of CGI-bin Python programs that communicate with the database.
* A Python daemon program that runs under systemd to perform background tasks,
* Documentation

For notes on individual files, see NOTES.

To find known bugs, temporary code and pending improvements, see NOTES and TODO, and run

grep -E "BUG|FIXME|TODO|HACK" *.py

To find files which hit the database, run

grep -El 'SET|UPDATE|SELECT|WHERE|DELETE' *.py
